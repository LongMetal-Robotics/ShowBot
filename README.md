# ShowBot
 The code for LongMetal's upcoming Show Bot

## Building
 As part of the build process (specific to us), Gradle runs scripts in the Bash shell.  
### \*NIX
 You should be able to build this project without any problems, as long as Bash is installed.  
### Windows
 Since Windows doesn't natively come with Bash, you must install it. As long as it is in your PATH (you can call it from the Run dialog, etc.), the project will build. Here is what we do to install Bash:  
 1. Install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/.  
 2. Find the location of the Bash binary (it should be C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin).
 3. Add that directory to PATH
 4. You should be all set!
